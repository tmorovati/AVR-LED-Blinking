## Introduction

This project is created for an AVR microcontroller course and serves as a basic example of working with AVR microcontrollers using CodeVision for programming and Proteus for simulation.

## Hardware Requirements

- An AVR microcontroller (e.g., ATmega series)
- An LED
- A current-limiting resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Requirements

- [CodeVisionAVR](https://www.hpinfotech.ro/cvavr.htm) - for writing and compiling the AVR code.
- [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/) - for simulating the AVR circuit.

## Setup and Usage



1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/avr-led-blink.git
2. Open the project in CodeVisionAVR.

3. Write and compile the AVR code for LED blinking.

4. Set up the hardware circuit as per the schematic in Proteus.

5. Import the hex file into Proteus to simulate the project.

6. Run the simulation and observe the LED blinking.

## Project Structure

This project contains two folders, first one is CodeVision, you can find the hex file in this folder. The other on is the Proteus. Simulations are stored there, and you need to have proteus in your system to run it. 

Hope you enjoy it.
